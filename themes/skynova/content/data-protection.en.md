We are pleased about your interest in our website. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Below, we provide information about the handling of your data when you use our website.

## Data Collection on This Website

### Cookies

Our website does not use cookies. No personal data is collected or stored through cookies.

### Inquiries via Email, Phone, or Fax

If you contact us via email, phone, or fax, your inquiry, including all personal data arising from it (e.g., name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We will not share this data without your consent.

The processing of this data is based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in effectively handling inquiries directed to us (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR), provided that such consent has been requested and granted; consent can be revoked at any time.

The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been fully processed). Mandatory legal provisions, particularly statutory retention periods, remain unaffected.

## No Third-Party Integration

Our website does not load resources from third parties (e.g., fonts, analytics services, or content from other platforms). All content is delivered directly from our server.
